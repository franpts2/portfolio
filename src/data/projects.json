The project centered on ensuring absolute data integrity through custom-built retransmission and timeout strategies. To prove the protocol's resilience, we stress-tested the implementation using a virtual cable simulation to inject real-time signal noise and physical disconnections, successfully demonstrating the system's ability to recover and deliver bit-perfect files under unstable network conditions.",
